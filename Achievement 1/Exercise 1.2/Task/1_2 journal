1.	Imagine you’re having a conversation with a future colleague about whether to use the iPython Shell instead of Python’s default shell. What reasons would you give to explain the benefits of using the iPython Shell over the default one?

In IPython shell code text is visibly clearer than the default one because of syntax highlighting displaying different features of your code in contrasting fonts and colors. Also, IPython automatically indent the text for nesting statements.

2.	Python has a host of different data types that allow you to store and organize information. List 4 examples of data types that Python recognizes, briefly define them, and indicate whether they are scalar or non-scalar.

Data type	| Definition                         |  Scalar or Non-Scalar?

int		    | This data type represents integers.|  Scalar

bool        | This data type stores either of two|  Scalar
____________| values—True or False		         |  

tuple       | Tuples are linear arrays that can  |  Non-Scalar
____________| store multiple values of any type. |

string      | Strings in Python are an immutable |  Non-Scalar
____________| array of character
		


3.	A frequent question at job interviews for Python developers is: what is the difference between lists and tuples in Python? Write down how you would respond.

I would say that unlike tuples lists are mutable in that the values within a list can be changed which makes tuples immutable

4.	In the task for this Exercise, you decided what you thought was the most suitable data structure for storing all the information for a recipe. Now, imagine you’re creating a language-learning app that helps users memorize vocabulary through flashcards. Users can input vocabulary words, definitions, and their category (noun, verb, etc.) into the flashcards. They can then quiz themselves by flipping through the flashcards. Think about the necessary data types and what would be the most suitable data structure for this language-learning app. Between tuples, lists, and dictionaries, which would you choose? Think about their respective advantages and limitations, and where flexibility might be useful if you were to continue developing the language-learning app beyond vocabulary memorization. 

I believe that dictionary would be the best choice in this scenario to wrap arround each of the vocabulary words. Each vocabulary would need 3 key value pairs even though they are all strings a user would want to search a vocabulary word and its respective information by searching the value of the key Name. I would also wrap every vocabulary words in a dictionary with the key being the language type and then wrap all of that in a list. Both dictionaries and lists are mutible so changing or adding any information would be easier.
