1.	In your own words, what is object-oriented programming? What are the benefits of OOP?
    OOP is a method of building and organizing them with classes. They make sure that no code is repeated making them quite efficient.


2.	What are objects and classes in Python? Come up with a real-world example to illustrate how objects and classes work.
classes are defined by objects which are variables and methods. A class of recipe the cooking time, ingredients and name are all objects of that recipe.

3.	In your own words, write brief explanations of the following OOP concepts; 100 to 200 words per method is fine. 

- Inheritance is the ability for subclasses of a parent class to inherit their objects and parameters.
- Polymorphism is when the same object is added to different classes or subclasses they do different functions.
- Operator Overloading is when a method is defined for a custom class to be able to use built-in operators which only work on built-in classes.
