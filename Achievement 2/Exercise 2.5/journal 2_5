1.	In your own words, explain Django static files and how Django handles them.

2.	Look up the following two Django packages on Django’s official documentation and/or other trusted sources. Write a brief description of each.


Package	                    Description
ListView	                A page representing a list of objects, displaying multiple instances of a table in a database
DetailView	                A view to display one instances of a table in a database.



3.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 2! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? You can use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 
For now, I am proud of the design of the recipes app that I have created. I am struggling a bit with the four steps to creating the different urls of the application, but I think a few refreshers will get me to more in depth understanding.
